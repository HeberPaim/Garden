Hi, I'm Heber. Here you'll encounter many pages about my own notes and thoughts. I'm trying new ways of thinking and take notes, as you'll note here. 


My notes will be mostly in english but sometimes you may encounter some files not translated yet. As always, I'm still learning. If you find some english error or something badly written, please send me an e-mail to help me fix it!
