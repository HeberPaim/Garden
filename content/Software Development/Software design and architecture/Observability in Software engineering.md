Observability is the extent to which the internal states of a system can be inferred from externally available data. An observable software system provides the ability to understand any issue that arises. Conventionally, the three pillars of observability data are metrics, logs and traces.

Some examples of softwares to deal with it are:

[[NewRelic]]
[[Dynatrace]]
