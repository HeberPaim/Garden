The objective of ADM is to produce standards for model-based reverse engineering of legacy systems.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture#cite_note-4) [Knowledge Discovery Metamodel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Discovery_Metamodel "Knowledge Discovery Metamodel") (KDM) is the furthest along of these efforts, and describes information systems in terms of various assets (programs, specifications, data, test files, database schemas, etc.).

As the concepts and technologies used to realize designs and the concepts and technologies used to realize architectures have changed at their own pace, decoupling them allows system developers to choose from the best and most fitting in both domains. The design addresses the functional ([use case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case "Use case")) requirements while architecture provides the infrastructure through which non-functional requirements like scalability, reliability and performance are realized. MDA envisages that the platform independent model (PIM), which represents a conceptual design realizing the functional requirements, will survive changes in realization technologies and [software architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture "Software architecture").
