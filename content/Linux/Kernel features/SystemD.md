It’s the _init_ system in many modern Linux distributions. Basically, it’s responsible for booting your system and managing services (you know, starting, stopping, enabling them)

Here’s the gist:

- It boots the system by initializing services in the correct order.
- Manages services, processes, and even mounts file systems while your system is running.
- Handles logging through **[[Journald]]**, so if something goes wrong, it knows who to blame.
- It replaces older systems like **SysVinit** and **Upstart** because it’s "newer" and does a ton more stuff. Yeah, it’s kind of a control freak.
